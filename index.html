                <h2>Why do I love reading books?</h2>
                <p>I've been reading books since I was a child. I saw the knowledge contained within encyclopedias as power that only those who take the time to dabble in books had. The feeling of knowing more and more about our world excited me, obtained from just reading words inked to paper no less!</p>
                <p>Novels and other stories also had the power to pull us from our reality. Transporting us to a world free from our worries. A world where heroes bravely fight against evil, a world where two souls meet and share sweet memories, a world where a person grasps the meaning of their life. No matter what story it is, there is always a lesson to learn, and inspirations gained.</p>

                <h2>What genre of books do I read?</h2>
                <p>For non-fiction books, I like reading books revolving around how things work. Like science textbooks that tell us about various phenomena that occur inside and outside our world. Philosophy books that turns our attention to the complexities of life, society, and mankind itself. And of course, psychology books that let us peer deeper on the inner workings of the human mind.</p>
                <p>When talking about fiction books, my tastes range from stories that take inspirations from real-world events to absurd works that bring out exaggerated representations of society and people. But what really catches my eye are stories that emphasize the relationship between people and stories that easily convey the complexity of society. It is quite a paradox for me. Though we read fiction, we still search for pieces of reality that we can relate to.</p>

                <h2>What do I gain from reading books?</h2>
                <p>Reading supplies us with knowledge that we can use in various ways. Be it making our life more convenient, helping other people, or just having a little fun fact to tell your friends at the gathering. This opens up a path so that I can learn more things, as there are concepts that cannot be learned without going through a topic first. Knowledge is a valuable asset in the modern world, where information is freely available but only those diligent enough to look for information will truly gain mastery.</p>
                <p>Even stories from fantasy worlds benefited me. These stories are a source of inspiration that keeps me marching forward in life, at times filling the void in my heart.</p>
