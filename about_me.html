                    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
                    <p>I am Noel Perfei D. Regulacion, a student from Eastern Visayas State University (Ormoc Campus). I am currently a first year in the university's Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I was a child, I have always loved reading. Back when I was not skilled enough to read, I would ask my parents what a certain word that I read meant. And they would always give me answers. Back then, I read encyclopedias, textbooks, and other educational materials. It always fascinated me how easy it is to gain information, which otherwise we wouldn't know if books didn't exist. </p>
                    <p>As time passed, I spent my time reading novels and storybooks. I was again amazed by how words can be used to convey feelings, emotions, textures, and even landscapes. Sure, the outside world does not lack excitement, but the refreshing and delightful realities found within these books are truly captivating.</p>
                    <p>Until now, I continue to be astounded by the knowledge written by scholars for the world to see. I continue to be fascinated by the worlds brought to reality by writers. And I continue to cherish the present that we have achieved through the power of words.</p>
                    <p>If you have any suggestions or inquiries about this website, or want to talk about books with me, you can reach me through the following:</p>
